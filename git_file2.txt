#ignoring files you don't want to track
Use the cmd "nano .gitignore" to create and edit the "gitignore" file.
This file defines which files git should ignore

Say you had already commited some files and added them to the ignore file
When you push this changes the files won't be ignored as they were still tracked prior.
Below is how you untrack files previously commited but should be ignore

>git rm -r --cached .
>git add .
>git commit -m "untrack ignored files"
>git push
